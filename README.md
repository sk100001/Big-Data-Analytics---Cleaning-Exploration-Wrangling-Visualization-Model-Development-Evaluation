*This repository covers the Data Science Process for two real world datasets*:
  
  1. HI-SEAS weather station data, that keeps a track of climate, weather conditions, as well as the solar radiation in the island of Hawii
  2. Open Food Facts Database
  
  
For the purpose of my project I have covered the following for both the datasets:
 - Data Exploration and Visualizations
 - Feature Engineering
 - Understanding the structure in the dataset
 - Data Pipelining for data processing and modeling
 - Cross Validation, Hyperparameter tuning
 
 The datasets used can be found here:
